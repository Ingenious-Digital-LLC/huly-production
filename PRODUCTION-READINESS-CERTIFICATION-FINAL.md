## ⚠️ CRITICAL PRODUCTION CONCERNS

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

1. **Service Startup Dependencies**
   - **Issue:** Initial deployment had service dependency failures
   - **Resolution:** Staggered startup required (databases first, then applications)
   - **Risk:** Service startup order critical for production reliability
   - **Mitigation:** Automated deployment scripts with proper ordering

2. **Internal Service Port Exposure**
   - **Issue:** Database ports (27017, 9200, 9000) potentially exposed
   - **Risk:** Direct database access possible if firewall not configured
   - **Required Action:** Implement proper firewall rules before production

3. **Elasticsearch "Yellow" Status**
   - **Status:** Functional but not optimal
   - **Cause:** Single-node configuration lacks redundancy
   - **Risk:** Search functionality may be impacted under high load
   - **Recommendation:** Monitor closely or implement clustering

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY CONCERNS

4. **CPU Load Pattern**
   - **Current:** 5.57 load average (elevated for 7.8GB system)
   - **Cause:** 8-day uptime with multiple services
   - **Risk:** May impact response times under additional load
   - **Monitoring:** Continuous CPU monitoring recommended

5. **Configuration Management**
   - **Issue:** Environment variable conflicts resolved during testing
   - **Risk:** Configuration drift in production deployments
   - **Mitigation:** Version-controlled configuration management
