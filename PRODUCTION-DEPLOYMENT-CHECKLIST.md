## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk Items (Acceptable)
- **Service Startup Time:** Some services take 1-2 minutes to become healthy
  - **Mitigation:** Extended health check timeouts configured
- **Memory Usage Growth:** Initial memory usage may increase during warm-up
  - **Mitigation:** Resource monitoring with 85% alert threshold
- **Minor Port Conflicts:** Some ports may conflict with existing services
  - **Mitigation:** Port mapping can be adjusted if needed

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk Items (Monitor Closely)
- **Application Service Health:** Some services showing "unhealthy" during startup
  - **Mitigation:** Allow 3-5 minutes for full initialization
  - **Escalation:** If unhealthy >10 minutes, investigate logs
- **Database Performance:** Initial database optimization may take time
  - **Mitigation:** Monitor query performance and index creation
  - **Escalation:** Performance issues affecting user experience
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Memory usage approaching system limits
  - **Mitigation:** Real-time monitoring with automated alerts
  - **Escalation:** If memory >90%, immediate intervention required

### ðŸ”´ High Risk Items (Immediate Response Required)
- **Complete Service Failure:** All containers failing to start
  - **Response:** Execute emergency rollback procedure
  - **Contact:** Immediate escalation to system administrator
- **Security Breach Indicators:** Unauthorized access attempts
  - **Response:** Isolate system, review logs, regenerate credentials
  - **Contact:** Security team notification required
- **Data Corruption:** Database integrity issues
  - **Response:** Stop services, assess damage, restore from backup
  - **Contact:** Data recovery specialist engagement

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (If Required)
```bash
# Stop current deployment
docker compose down

# Restore previous configuration
cp backups/pre-deployment-*/compose.yml ./
cp backups/pre-deployment-*/huly.conf ./

# Restart with previous configuration
docker compose up -d

# Verify rollback success
./monitor-resources.sh
```

### Rollback Decision Criteria
